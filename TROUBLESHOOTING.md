# Troubleshooting

Common issues and fixes for tools in this dotfiles repository.

## tmux

### Server exited unexpectedly

**Symptom:** Running `tmux` gives the error:
```
server exited unexpectedly
```

**Cause:** A stale socket file remains after tmux crashed, was killed abruptly, or the system rebooted.

**Fix:**
```bash
rm -f /tmp/tmux-$(id -u)/default
```

Then start tmux normally.

### Yazi crashes tmux server when opened in popup

**Symptom:** Opening yazi in a tmux popup shows "Terminal response timeout" and crashes the entire tmux server.

**Cause:** Yazi sends terminal capability detection queries via passthrough sequences at startup. tmux 3.6a does not support passthrough in `display-popup` (passthrough only works in regular panes). The unhandled sequences corrupt the tmux server state.

**Status:** A fix was proposed in [tmux issue #4329](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/4329) but has not been committed yet. The issue is closed but the code change was never merged into tmux master or any release.

**Current implementation:** The yazi binding (`prefix + Y`) opens yazi in a new tmux window instead of a popup to avoid this issue. Passthrough works correctly in regular windows.

**Future:** Once tmux releases a version with the passthrough popup fix, the binding can be changed back to use a popup if desired.
